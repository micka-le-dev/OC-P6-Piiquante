This is the back end server for Project 6 of the Web Developer path.

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have `Node` and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Back end Installation ###

1) Clone this repo. Run `npm install`.
2) You can then run the server with `node server` or `npm start`.
3) The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Server listen on port 3001`.
